# Hey, I'm Petrarka

 I am specializing in FPGA design, embedded systems, and applying neural networks where they make a real difference. I like precision, depth, and taking on projects that others might pass on.

---

## What I Work With

- **Languages**: Python, C/C++, Verilog, VHDL
- **Hardware**: FPGAs, microcontrollers
- **Tools**: MATLAB, LTspice

---

## Current Focus 

- **Neural Networks**: Working on efficient CNNs for embedded platforms.
- **FPGA Projects**: Digging into signal processing, ML, and optimizing real-time performance.
- **Compilers**: Learning compiler theory to build something from the ground up.

## GitHub Goals ðŸ“ˆ

Here to document projects and connect with others in **embedded systems**, **ML**, and **FPGA design**. If youâ€™re tackling complex builds, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™m always up for collaboration.
